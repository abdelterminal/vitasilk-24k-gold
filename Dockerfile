# Next.js 16 standalone build. Three stages so the published image carries the
# server and its traced dependencies only — no source, no package manager, no
# build toolchain.
#
# Build from this project's own directory:
#   docker build -t vitasilk-24k-gold .

# ---- deps ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Separated from the build so a source-only change reuses the cached install.

COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# `npm ci`, not `npm install`: it installs exactly the lockfile and fails loudly
# if the two disagree, so a container build can never silently resolve a
# different dependency tree than the one tested locally.
#
# The dev dependencies are required here — TypeScript, Tailwind and sharp are
# all devDependencies and all run during `next build`.
RUN npm ci

# unreachable, app/api/order/route.ts appends the lead to data/orders.jsonl —

# USER nextjs. Mount a volume over it (see docker-compose.yml) or the orders it
# catches disappear with the container.
